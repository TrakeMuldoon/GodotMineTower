Mining game idle ish.

You start with a home base and a miner,

Gameplay loop:
	You drill down, and then return once you run out of fuel(battery), or tether?
	You find resource nodes, and grab them, or drop miners on them.
	You then upgrade, and go deeper/further from home base

Big Plans: 
		After mining, you can upgrade to go to the ocean, clouds and outer space
			Like Spore, each of these will have essentially the same gameplay loop
